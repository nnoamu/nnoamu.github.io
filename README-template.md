## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned


My main takeaways from this project:
 - If you want to center something, start with margin left and right : auto style, the box/div/etc you want to center will stay there in desktop and mobile screens too

- I learned to make image overlay and through it, the essence of absolute/relative positions

- I learned and recapped some positioning techniques (flexbox, top,bottom,left,right, positions)

- I deepen my knowledge about the box model and its properties

- I deepen my knowledge about the css color schemes

- I deepen my knowledge about basic responsible solutions through media queries


### Continued development

I still want to learn more about positioning, I may remake this project sometime with bootstrap or with other libraries.
